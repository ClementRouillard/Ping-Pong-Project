# Project Ping Pong

The objective of this project was to determine the moment of impact of the ball with the ground. To do this, we used different models to establish the equations governing the speed and position of the ball as a function of time.

## HOW TO LAUNCH ?
```
python ./Projet-ping-pong.py 
```

In the case of python 3, the command is:

```
python3 ./Projet-ping-pong.py 
```
